## Git, GitHub

*What is the URL of the GitHub repo that you created in your personal account?*
   The URL of my personal account is: https://github.com/Heritier1990/heritier_repo
   
*What is pull vs clone in GitHub?*
clone copies the entire repository, whereas pull updates the local repository with changes made remotely. In addition, clone is used only once to create a local repository, whereas pull can be used every time something has been modified.  

*You have committed a change on your local machine/remote. However, you want to undo the changes committed. How would you do that?*
I will will create a new commit that undoes the changes made in the last commit and push it to the remote repository by typing these commands git revert HEAD
git push origin main

## Markdown
*Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items*
- Participant:She, her, them
- Criteria:
    - Height
    - Weight
    - Color
- Countries:
    - Cameroon
    - Mali
    - Burkina Faso

*Write a single paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, code, and includes a link. The paragraph must explain your favorite Olympic sport/game, the country that won the most number of olympic GOLD medals (Summer) in your favorite sport in 2020 (Japan) and 2024 (France). You are free to include more information.

My favorite olympic sport is **men-s marathon**. _Kenya_ won the most number of gold medal in the men's marathon at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. At Paris in 2024, ***Ethiopia*** won the most and obtained the  a new Olympic record of 2:06:26. To access that information, you need to type a code `sprint() ` when open the following [link](https://www.olympics.com/en/news/paris-2024-all-results-as-ethiopia-tola-tamirat-takes-marathon-gold-with-olympic-record).

*Create a level 3 heading*
### Parameters

*Insert a image of your favorite Olympics sport/game, sized appropriately*
![This is the image of my marathon competitors in 2024 at Paris](https://github.com/odu-cs625-datavis/public-Spring25-aveerasa/pull/40/commits/441ac9ab4780f993ab98ad95d0ee763c842635be)

## Tableau

*Insert the image of your horizontal bar chart here. Reminder, this should show countries that won the least number of medals only (excluding ZERO) in Paris2024 Summer Olynpics by continent (one country from each continent is ok).*
![This is the image of my first chart on Tabeau](https://github.com/odu-cs625-datavis/public-Spring25-aveerasa/pull/40/commits/6caef37058b5a959cbeb029131b1fde0c137b946)

## Google Colab

*What is the URL of your Google Colab notebook?*
[Here is the link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pekP0dLmmaGegSfc0MekL37J-auMf_nq?usp=sharing)

## Python/Seaborn

*Insert the first penguin chart here*
![first image](https://github.com/Heritier1990/public-Spring25-aveerasa/commit/aa89d263c4018843d136748da8839c8a334418a7)

*Describe what the figure is showing.*
The image isscatterplot  representing the depth and length of the penguin's bill. Depth ranges from 0 to 25 mm, while length can reach 60 mm. The pattern of markings suggests that there are three main groups. In the first group, the bill has a depth of between 16 mm and 20 mm, with a length of between 35 mm and 42 mm. In the second group, the bill has a depth of between 5 and 16 mm and a length of between 42 and 52 mm. The rest of the small number of penguins have bill whose dimensions vary greatly from one penguin to another.

*Insert the second penguin chart here*
![second image](https://github.com/Heritier1990/public-Spring25-aveerasa/commit/6bd28cef9724c1ee6c6e27acce08c5b65345a498)

*Describe what the figure is showing.*
The image depicts the body mass of three species - Adeline, Gentoo and Chinstrap - as a function of sex. It shows that, whatever the species, males are at least 500g heavier than females. What's more, the Gentoo weighs almost 1000g more than the Ad√©lie and Chinstrap, which appear to have the same weight.

*What happened when you removed the outer parentheses from the code? Why?*

## Observable and Vega-Lite

*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`?*

*What happens when you replace `markCircle()` with `markPoint()`?*

*What change do you need to make to swap the x and y axes on the scatterplot?*

*Insert the bar chart image here*

*Why do you think this chart is the result of this code change?*

## References

*Every report must list the references (including the URL) that you consulted while completing the assignment. Replace the items below with the references you consulted*

* Reference 1, <https://www.example.com>
* Reference 2, <https://www.example.com/reallyreallyreally-extra-long-URI/>
